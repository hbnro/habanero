Hello World!
===========

It's basically a php framework, useful to develop web applications, and also websites.

The main idea here is expressiveness and simplicity, based on the most simple and beautiful concepts that I have learned.

Features
--------

  * By default the main core is extensible, configurable and hookable using middleware.
  * Primarly provides a routing system, request/response is are friendly-url based.
  * It has a bootstrap mechanism and a detailed error reporting behavior.
  * The helpers are function libraries or prototyped static classes.
  * Integrated i18n for most basic language operations.
  * Many more utilities, and so on.

Installation
------------

Â¿Do you like magic? Just copy+paste in your command line.

    $ curl -L http://is.gd/gettetl | sh

NOTE: this method is working only on Ubuntu based systems.

If everything is all right the **tetl** executable should be available.

    $ tetl -s

Command line utility
--------------------

To create a project using the bundled `app/mvc` middleware first execute:

    $ cd /www/vhosts
    $ mkdir -p sandbox && cd sandbox
    $ tetl app.gen

This will create some directories and some blank files.

You can perform the vhost configurations to get your application ready:

    $ sudo tetl --vhost

The script will attempt to find out where are the vhost directories
and will perform modifications on their files.

NOTE: this method is working only on Ubuntu based systems.

Alternate start
---------------

Also you can write simple applications from scratch using code like this:

    require 'tetlphp/framework/initialize.php';

    run(function () {

      import('tetl/server');

      route('*', function () {
        echo 'Hello world!';
      });

    });
